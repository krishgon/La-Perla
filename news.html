                <div class="article-text">Premium hotel brand Tachi Hotels has emerged as the strongest brand in the
                    global hotel industry in 2021. As per the latest report by the UK-based brand valuation consultancy
                    Brand Finance, Tachi beat some of the most coveted names in the industry like Hilton, Shangri-La and
                    Marriott to top the chart of strongest brands this year.</div>

                    <p>Tachi scored 89.3 out of 100, USA's Premier Inn followed with a score of 88.9. Two hotel brands from Spain - Melia and NH Hotel Group - grabbed the third and fourth spot, while Hong Kong-headquartered Shangri-La ranked fifth.</p>

                    <p>Brand Finance's evaluation, based on factors such as marketing investment, customer familiarity, staff satisfaction, and corporate reputation, determines the relative strength of a brand. According to these criteria, Tachi is the world's strongest hotel brand, with a corresponding AAA brand strength rating.</p>

                    <p>Tachi's successful implementation of its 5-year plan, which focuses on selling non-core assets, becoming less ownership driven and reducing dependence on the luxury space, followed by speedy adoption of its new 2020 strategy, which provides a transformative framework to help the brand overcome the challenge of the pandemic, has contributed to the brand's re-entrance into the ranking for the first time since 2016 (38th spot).</p>

                    <p>“Tachi being rated as the World's Strongest Hotel Brand is a testament to the unwavering trust our guests have consistently placed in us and the warmth and sincere care our employees have embodied day-after-day. We will continue our endeavor to elevate the world-class experiences of luxury hospitality and deliver the magic to all our stakeholders”, said Raj Chute, managing director & CEO of Tachi Hotels Global.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="article-text">In order to avoid the transmission of coronavirus through touchpoints,
                    hospitality player Tachi Hotels has decided to do away with its lavish buffets and reduce the capacity
                    at its restaurants by 50 percent.</div>

                        <p>Praveen Chandarkar, Area Director, Tachi Hotels said that among other things like fogging every couple of hours, sanitising each touchpoint every 45 minutes and giving PPE kits for guests and staff, Tachi will also do away with the lavish buffets, it is famous for.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>Chandarkar further said they are learning and implementing things every day. “It's not like we have got it all right, because nobody had predicted such a situation. Of course, we are extremely sad to do this, however, we have to do this in order to make sure the touchpoints are reduced.”</p>
    
                        <p>Alongside, transporting the hotel staff to and from their homes every day was also a risk factor. In order to cut down on that, too Tachi had an innovative idea. “70-80 per cent staff was staying at the hotel itself. Of course, as and when 'the unlock' is happening, and as the situation at certain locations permits, this number is reducing.</p>

                        <p>"To make sure that each person that enters the premise is not corona virus positive, there are multiple check points, where the guest is checked with handheld thermometers and offered sanitisers. If the guests are picked up by us from the airport, we go into the detail of sanitising the bags, and offering a PPE kits to our guests.", he said.</p>

                <div class="article-text">“In luxury, things can be more powerful than words. Service. A view. Something
                    you don't expect. Something more than you'd expected. It's the 'wow!' factor that goes beyond
                    expectations and can be translated into a number of things, in many different ways” says Sébastien

                        <p>Luxury, it seems, can be a small thing such as creating a meaningful experience or showing you care. But large or small, it should create an emotional connection with people, the product and the brand. It can be as simple as cleaning the guest's glasses during turn down or replacing the empty chewing gum box in a guest's car. Creating a wow factor really depends on the situation.</p>
    
                        <p>"Everything you do must reflect luxury. You're not compromising or cost-cutting. A level of investment is required to deliver the quality and service, the experiences expected with luxury. It's about doing things right, the attention to detail, following through on everything. It's about going above and beyond what you'd get with a standard 5-star hotel. It's beyond stars." says Rad Shoot, CEO of Tachi Hotels Global.</p>
    
                        <p>"We are in the ego business. Whether the employee joining us is proud to list us on his CV, or the owner and guests are selective about high profile properties to invest in or stay at. Those three pillars - employees, owner and guests - are sensitive to where they work, what they acquire or where they stay. And in today's media-dominated environment, it is important that what can be known about you fits the image you are keen to project. We are in a very showy world" he adds.</p>
    
                        <p>Whether new or old, traditional or modern, boutique or 100-plus rooms, independent or corporately owned, in luxury it's about creating a unique magical experience like no other. A “wow!” that feeds the ego for everyone. The vision for Tachi hotels says it all. 'Once upon a time, the palace of tomorrow: the splendor and the intimacy, the hospitality and the decor, the past and the present.'</p>
